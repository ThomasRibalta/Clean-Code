# Clean-Code

Welcome to the Clean Code Repository. This repository contains various examples of functions, comments, and variable names inspired by the principles outlined in the book [*Clean Code: A Handbook of Agile Software Craftsmanship*](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/3735293-clean-code) by Robert C. Martin.

## About the Book

*Clean Code* is a seminal work in the field of software development that provides practical advice on writing clean, readable, and maintainable code. The book covers a range of topics, including best practices for naming variables, writing functions, comments, unit testing, and refactoring. It has served as an invaluable resource for developers looking to improve the quality of their code and adhere to agile development principles.

## Purpose of This Repository

This repository was created as part of a presentation aimed at demonstrating the principles of clean code as described by Robert C. Martin. The examples provided here are adapted from the book and serve to illustrate the following concepts:

- **Meaningful Names**: Choosing clear and descriptive names for variables, functions, and classes.
- **Functions**: Writing small, single-purpose functions that are easy to understand and maintain.
- **Comments**: Using comments to explain the "why" behind the code, rather than the "what".
- **Error Handling**: Managing errors in a way that keeps the code clean and readable.
- **Code Formatting**: Consistently formatting code to enhance readability.

## Examples

In this repository, you will find examples that highlight:

- Proper naming conventions
- Well-structured and commented functions
- Techniques for refactoring code to make it cleaner and more maintainable
- Effective use of error handling
- Code formatting practices

Each example includes a description of the concept being demonstrated, along with the original and refactored code for comparison.
